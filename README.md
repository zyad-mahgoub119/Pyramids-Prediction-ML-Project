# Pyramids-Prediction-ML-Project
This project analyzes a dataset of Egyptian pyramids to uncover historical trends through data visualization and machine learning. It models the evolution of pyramid construction, predicts when the era of pyramid-building likely ended, and attempts to classify pyramids to their respective dynasties based on their dimensions.
